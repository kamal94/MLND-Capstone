This project is the culmination of my work over the MLND program at Udacity and my summer Research Experience for Undergraduates at UCCS (Colorado). All the information required to understand this project is in the file **Report.pdf**. A companion python notebook has been provided for the exploration of the data and reproducibility.

To run the python notebook, you will need to install the following prerequisite programs

### Install

This project requires **Python 3.5** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [Pickle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org)
- [PIL](http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/)
- [colour](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/colour)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

### Code

Exploration code is provided in the notebook `clustering companion.ipynb` notebook file. 

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `student_intervention/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```ipython notebook Clustering\ notebook.ipynb.ipynb```  
```jupyter notebook Clustering\ notebook.ipynb.ipynb```

This will open the iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser.

## Data
To use the python notebook, you will have to download the dataset for this project. The dataset used in this project can be [downloaded from the cloud](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzyCB-i-aKDWU2pBYkVoOV81S3M/view).
